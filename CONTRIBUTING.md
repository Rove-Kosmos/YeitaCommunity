## How to become a contributor ?

Everyone can contribute and improve this knowledge base, member or not. But Yeita members can become editors and monitor contributions.

To contribute, the best way is to go to https://communaute-yeita.gitbook.io/welcome-to-gitbook/ (you can ask for editor access on Slack) and to create a new entry.

Don't worry, you'll not break anything.
If you need help, you can ask Yeita members on Slack.
